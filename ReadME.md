In order to get better at documenting code I will be using this from Day 7 Onwards to record the progress of the creation of my solution.

# Day 6

I lied, Day 6 is absolutely kicking my behind. The first part was simple enough, simply leave a trail of breadcrumbs behind and count the number of breadcrumbs.
Part two is a lot harder. I've tried many methods but eventually optimised it down to simply putting an object on the squares the guard went to, 1966 was my answer. Wrong.
More debugging, literal hours, and still nothing. Thus, having taken so long, I am going to ask the AI for a hint. A hint bear in mind, not an outright explanation. Thus I have failed
Day 6, I hope it is a good learning point for me.
